Python was conceived in the late 1980s[39] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[40] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[10] Its implementation began in December 1989.[41] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's Benevolent Dictator For Life, a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.[42] He now shares his leadership as a member of a five-person steering council.[43][44][45] In January 2019, active Python core developers elected Brett Cannon, Nick Coghlan, Barry Warsaw, Carol Willing and Van Rossum to a five-member "Steering Council" to lead the project.[46] Guido van Rossum has since then withdrawn his nomination for the 2020 Steering council.[47]

Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for Unicode.[48]

Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible.[49] Many of its major features were backported to Python 2.6.x[50] and 2.7.x version series. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates (at least partially) the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[51]

Python 2.7's end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[52][53] No more security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[54][55] With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.6.x[56] and later are supported.

Python 3.9.2 and 3.8.8 were expedited[57] as all versions of Python (including 2.7[58]) had security issues, leading to possible remote code execution[59] and web cache poisoning.[60]

The Gutenberg Bible contains the Latin version of the Hebrew Old Testament and the Greek New Testament, mainly the work of Jerome (c.345-420 AD) who translated some biblical texts from the originals and in other instances revised older Latin translations. He began his work on the translation in 380 AD.

In the course of time, Jerome's text was subject to change, and hand-written Latin Bibles in the West often diverged on substantial points, partly under the influence of earlier translations, and partly as a result of differences which inevitably arise whenever a book is copied by a scribe.

In Paris, in the 12th century, an attempt was made to create a standard Latin Bible, but the textual basis was criticized even by contemporaries and, as a result of the desire to create a better standard, the text was subjected to much change in the subsequent period.

The text of the Bible as it appears in the Gutenberg Bible is the result of emendations of the Parisian Bible tradition, but it is already quite different from the standard which had been established 200 years earlier. It is close to a group of manuscripts written in the area of the Rhine in the 14th and 15th centuries.

The Gutenberg Bible became the basis on which further emendations to the Bible were made. Not until the 20th century was an attempt made to reject the unsystematically corrected text, and to reconstitute Jerome's translation on the basis of a critical assessment of manuscript evidence.

The text of the Gutenberg Bible is placed in a philological context in Heinrich Schneider, Der Text der Gutenbergbibel zu ihrem 500järigen Jubiläum untersucht, Bonner biblische Beiträge, 7 (Bonn, 1954).

A discussion of its relation to the tradition of the Vulgate, and a complete list of the texts included in the Gutenberg Bible can be found in Robert Weber, 'Der Text der Gutenbergbibel und seine Stellung in der Geschichte der Vulgata', in: Johannes Gutenbergs zweiundvierzigzeilige Bibel, Faksimile-Ausgabe nach dem Exemplar der Staatsbibliothek Preußischer Kulturbesitz Berlin: Kommentarband, ed. W. Schmidt and F. A. Schmidt-Künsemüller (Munich, 1979), 9-31.

The text in relation to the work of the printers is discussed by Paul Needham, 'The Text of the Gutenberg Bible', in Trasmissione dei testi a stampa nel periodo moderno, vol. II: Il seminario internazionale Roma-Viterbo 27-29 giugno 1985, ed. by Giovanni Crapulli (Rome, 1987), pp. 43-84, and Paul Needham, 'The Changing Shape of the Vulgate Bible in Fifteenth-century Printing Shops', in The Bible as Book: The First Printed Editions, ed. by Kimberley van Kampen and Paul Saenger (London, 1999), pp. 53-70.

Kristian Jensen, 'Printing the Bible in the Fifteenth Century: Devotion, Philology and Commerce', in Incunabula and Their Readers: Printing, Selling and Using Books in the Fifteenth Century, edited by Kristian Jensen (London: The British Library, 2003), pp. 115-138, discusses how commercial imperatives changed the texts of the Bible and who bought and used Bibles in the 15th century.

An account of the principles followed in the critical edition of the Vulgate prepared under the supervision of a Papal committee since 1908 is found in Henri Quentin, Mémoire sur l'établissement du texte de la Vulgate, Ière partie,Octateuque, Collectanea biblica latina, 6 (Rome and Paris, 1922). This work received a mixed critical response.
